CoAP Optimization Report
CoAP Client Message Compression:
 Implementation:
  CoAP message compression is enabled in the client before making requests.
  Compressed messages reduce payload size, saving energy during data transmission.
 Scenarios for Benefit:
  Networks with limited bandwidth where reducing payload size is crucial.
  Environments with high data transfer costs, such as cellular networks.
  Battery-powered devices where minimizing data transmission directly impacts energy consumption.
